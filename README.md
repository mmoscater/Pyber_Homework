Data Analysis:

1. Based on the data available for 2016, it shows that the greatest count of drivers are concentrated in the Urban city types. This is supported by the following pie chart, and is also able to be determined by the size of points in the below bubble chart.

2. Another observation that can be made from the available data is for Rural areas. Although they have the smallest percentage of drivers (2.6%), the fares and total rides are twice the total driver percentage (6.8% and 5.3%, respectively). See charts below:

![Total Rides](Percent%20of%20Total%20Rides%20by%20City%20Type.png)

3. Lastly, from the below bubble chart, it can be identified, that as the number of rides increase, the average fare decreases. Mostly rural trips have higher fares with less total rides, whereas urban fares are typically lower and have a higher total number rides. Suburban Pyber ride shares fall inbetween.
